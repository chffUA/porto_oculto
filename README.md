# Porto Oculto - Enterprise Android app

Android app (Java) using GPS, camera, enterprise architecture, firebase, custom layouts, QOL touches.

This repository is a mirror of the app's state when it was first delivered. I did not do all of this alone.

Useful examples: 

	- using dexter to ask for multiple permissions at once

	- asks for camera permission, takes a picture, compresses and sends it to firebase
	
	- placing markers on a Google Maps map (and storing them in a db)
	
	- tap text field to show keyboard, tap elsewhere on the screen to hide keyboard
	
	- fragment-based navigation
	
	- DAO pattern for database access
	
	- view-model-viewmodel pattern for data, presentation and interaction
